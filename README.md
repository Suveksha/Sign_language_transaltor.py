In this program we use the MNIST Sign Language dataset to train a model which translates sign language into text. This Project is made by Himanshu Singh and Suveksha Chettri.
Since the dataset that we used was huge, the train dataset couldn't be uploaded. Hence kindly visit this link to download the dataset:-https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist
